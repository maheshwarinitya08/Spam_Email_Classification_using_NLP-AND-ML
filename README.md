# Spam_Email_Classification_using_NLP-AND-ML

A machine learning-based application for classifying emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**. This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Naive Bayes classifier** for efficient text-based email spam detection. The system includes a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface for real-time classification.  

## Features  
- **Spam Detection**: Classifies emails as spam or non-spam.  
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.  
- **Streamlit Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for input and results.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant classification of input email text.  

## Requirements  
### Hardware Requirements  
- **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or higher  
- **RAM**: Minimum 8 GB  
- **Storage**: At least 256 GB free disk space  

### Software Requirements  
- **Python 3.8 or higher**  
- Required Python libraries:  
  - `streamlit`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pickle`
